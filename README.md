# Would You Rather...? Project

This project is the third project for Udacity's React Nanodegree course.

## Setup and Run

To setup the project to run:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server and debugger with `expo start`

Once the development environment started up, 
you can use an Android device with the [Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) installed to scan the QR code and run the app (the project is only tested on Android at this time).

## Usage

The initial screen has a list of card decks. You can tap on one to see more details, start a quiz or add a new question card. On the bottom tab, you can access a menu to add a new deck to the list.

Once a quiz is started, you will see a question. You can tap the "See Answer" button to see the answer and mark your guess as correct or incorrect. Marking your guess will lead you to the next question. You will see your score at the final of the quiz.
